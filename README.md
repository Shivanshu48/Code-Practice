## 🧩 About the Project

This repository contains my solutions to various **coding challenges and algorithmic problems**, implemented in **Java** and **C++**.  
Each problem has its own directory, following a clear and consistent naming pattern for easy navigation.

### 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Practice DSA for competitive programming  
- Maintain clean and modular code  
- Serve as a reference hub for future revision

## 📁 Repository Structure

A glimpse of the folder organization:

Code-Practice/

      │
      ├── 1-two-sum/
      │ ├── TwoSum.java
      │ └── TwoSum.cpp
      │
      ├── 11-container-with-most-water/
      │ ├── ContainerWithMostWater.java
      │ └── ContainerWithMostWater.cpp
      │
      ├── 1013-fibonacci-number/
      │ ├── FibonacciNumber.java
      │ └── FibonacciNumber.cpp
      │
      └── ...

🧱 **Folder Naming Convention:**

- Each folder starts with a problem number or ID  
- Contains implementations in one or both languages (Java/C++)

## 🧮 Languages Used

| Language | % Usage | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 🟦 **Java** | ~65% | Primary language for solving algorithmic problems |
| 🟩 **C++** | ~35% | Secondary implementation for speed and low-level understanding |
